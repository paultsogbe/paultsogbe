## 👨🏿‍💻 About me

👀 **Looking for new opportinties 
✨ **Full-Stack JavaScript developer**

I worked in the telecommuication industry before 2020 and then I discovered my passion for ✨ **code** ! 

In 2020-2021 I followed a number of different trainings at [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/), [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/) and finally I decided to go even further by joining a Bootcamp at [Le Reacteur](https://www.lereacteur.io/) to become a Full-Stack Web & Mobile Developer.

After that I worked at a start-up called [Istya] (https://istya.co/), where I developed in complete autonomy their mobile application using React Native and their web platform using React.

Now I am ready for my next professional opportunity as a Full-Stack JavaScript developer!
